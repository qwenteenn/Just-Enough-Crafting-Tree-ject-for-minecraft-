# Just-Enough-Crafting-Tree-ject-for-minecraft-

JECT displays a detailed crafting tree for each item. It allows users to visualize all required recipes and dynamically choose the crafting path based on their preferences or available resources.
The mod is compatible with recipes from other installed mods.

JEI is not required but is strongly recommended. Without JEI, the crafting tree will only be accessible for items currently held by the player.

It is recommended to check the full crafting tree to make sure it fits your requirements.

I will review every suggestion and reported bug. Thank you for your feedback.
